# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple tic tac toe (naughts and crosses) game to get better at my SDL2 api knowlage. In this I learn how to play sounds and render ttf fonts.

### How to build

    All you need to do is go into "/src" and type "make" into the terminal. To run it type "make run" or "./tic-tac-toe.build" 
    There are prebuilt files for linux.
